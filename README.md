Title: Epic Notes App

Description: Secure place to store thoughts. User can sign up or log in and then pick the color theme of the app in the top right corner. The user can add and delete notes, and existing notes are stored for future access. There is also a search by title functionality so that once the user has accumulated so many notes that they can't keep track of them, the user can search for specific notes. 

How to start: 
download nodejs,
run "npm start"

Most interesting challenges we encountered:
How to implement the login functionality. 
Storing notes as objects as opposed to strings to be saved and allow for different user logins. 
Figuring out how to use one class to edit the color theme, and have that class call upon different color themes. 

Known bugs:
None
